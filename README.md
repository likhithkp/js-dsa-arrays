## Creating and Initializing Arrays

- **Creating an Array**: Learn how to declare arrays using different syntaxes.
- **Initializing an Array**: Understand how to initialize arrays with various methods.

## Array Operations

- **What all can an array store?**: Learn the versatility of arrays in storing various types of data.
- **Array Length Property**: Understand how to access and modify the length property of arrays.
- **Add/Remove Items in an Array**:
  - **Push and Pop Method**: Add and remove elements from the end of the array.
  - **Shift and Unshift Method**: Add and remove elements from the beginning of the array.

## Looping through Arrays

- **For Loop**: Learn how to iterate over arrays using a traditional `for` loop.
- **While Loop**: Understand the `while` loop and its use in array traversal.

## Inbuilt Traversal Methods

- **map()**: Transform array elements using the `map` method.
- **filter()**: Filter elements based on a condition using the `filter` method.
- **reduce()**: Accumulate array values with the `reduce` method.
- **some()**: Check if any element in the array meets a condition.
- **every()**: Ensure all elements meet a condition.
- **find()**: Find the first element that satisfies a condition.

## Advanced Array Methods

- **Spread and Rest Operators**: Learn how to work with the spread (`...`) and rest (`...`) operators in arrays.
- **concat()**: Merge two or more arrays.
- **slice()**: Extract a portion of an array without modifying the original.
- **splice()**: Modify an array by adding/removing elements at specific positions.
- **fill()**: Fill an array with a static value.
- **findIndex()**: Find the index of the first element that satisfies a condition.
- **flat()**: Flatten an array of arrays into a single array.
- **reverse()**: Reverse the order of elements in an array.
- **sort()**: Sort array elements based on a specified order.

## DSA Interview Questions

This section covers common DSA interview questions related to arrays, providing solutions and explanations.

### Ques 1 - Second Largest Number

- **Solution #1 - Brute Force Approach**: Find the second largest number in an array using a straightforward method.
- **Solution #2 - Optimized Approach**: Use a more efficient approach with a single pass through the array.
- **Time Complexity**: Analyze the time complexity of both approaches.
- **Space Complexity**: Review the space complexity of each solution.

### Ques 2 - Rotate Array by K

- **Solution #1 - Using Inbuilt JS Functions**: Rotate the array using JavaScript's built-in functions.
- **Solution #2 - Without Inbuilt Functions**: Implement a manual rotation of the array.
- **Time Complexity**: Understand the time complexity of both methods.
- **Space Complexity**: Discuss the space complexity for both approaches.

### Ques 3 - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

- **Solution #1 - With Inbuilt JS Methods**: Remove duplicates using built-in JavaScript methods.
- **Solution #2 - Two Pointer Approach**: Optimize the solution with a two-pointer technique.
- **Time Complexity**: Analyze the time complexity for both solutions.
- **Space Complexity**: Compare the space complexity of each approach.
